# MDPI_Journal_GENES_Uterine_Cancers-Characterization_through_Gene_Expression_Analysis

This repository collects the code used for the work "Uterine Cervix and Corpus Cancers Characterization through Gene Expression Analysis Using the KnowSeq Tool," prepared as a submission for GENES (MDPI Journal).

The folder "Data_References" contains the sample sheets from GDC (Genomics Data Portal) referencing the sample files used for this project, as well as clinical tables for the patients from whom the samples were taken. 

The project is divided into three experiments:

* Determination of a Gene Signature for the Characterization of Three Types of Uterine Tissues: Cervical Cancer, Uterine Corpus Cancer, and Healthy Uterine Tissue (Cervix/Corpus).

* Determination of a Gene Signature for the Characterization of the Two Main Histological Subtypes of Cervix Cancer: Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

* Study of Cervical Adenosquamous Carcinoma in Relation to the Two Main Histological Subtypes of Cervix Cancer.

The flowchart followed to analyze the input data with the scripts stored in this repository is as follows:
